# Power_Loss_Monte_Carlo
This project determines the power loss in the system due to the given damage scenario faced by system. The failure probability of line as a function of wind speed is taken to determine damage scenario. Monte Carlo Simulation is implemented to find loss due to given damage scenario. This code can be generalized to any system and any type of damage.
